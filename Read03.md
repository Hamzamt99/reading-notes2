It's easy to become lost in the process of handing down functions as props.
It happens when you call a new component during the render.
You pass your function as a prop during that component call. 
In my demonstration, the prop is named "clickMe."
## Conclusion
React is basically magic. It is a very powerful tool when it comes to making online web applications. The use of state and props is vital for presenting things to the user. 
I have created a simple demonstration showing the capabilities of being able to pass functions down as props. This way, you can have the ability to maneuver around in different components and still have state in only one component. It is scary to see how many helpful functions we have with React, 
and the more you learn about React, the more exciting it becomes. As the possibilities become endless with what you can create.
