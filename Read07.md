# REST :
## Who is Roy Fielding? 
Roy T. Fielding, Senior Principal Scientist at Adobe, is known for his pioneering work on the World Wide Web, open source, and software architecture. 
He wrote the standards for HTTP/1.x and URI, has been a contributor to many other Web technologies, and defined the REST architectural style. Dr. Fielding is a founder of the Apache HTTP Server Project,
Chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, member of the ASF board of directors, and author of the Apache License 2.0. He has been honored with the ACM Software System Award, ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award, OSCON 2000 Appaloosa Award for Vision, ICSE Most Influential Paper, and MIT Technology Review's first TR100. 
Dr. Fielding received his Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
## What these do :
GET: GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.

POST: POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

PUT:  used to update resource available on the server

PATCH: in computing, the PATCH method is a request method supported by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol for making partial changes to an existing resource.
The PATCH method provides an entity containing a list of changes to be applied to the resource requested 

## API Keys: 
Cloud Endpoints handles both API keys and authentication schemes, such as Firebase or Auth0. The main distinction between these two is:

API keys identify the calling project — the application or site — making the call to an API.

Authentication tokens identify a user — the person — that is using the app or site.
API keys provide project authorization
To decide which scheme is most appropriate, it's important to understand what API keys and authentication can provide.

API keys provide

Project identification — Identify the application or the project that's making a call to this API

Project authorization — Check whether the calling application has been granted access to call the API and has enabled the API in their project
