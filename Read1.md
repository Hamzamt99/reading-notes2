*HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph?
Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), 
structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.*
# What is JS ?
*JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). 
Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.*
