## Creating a Chart
It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single <canvas> node to render the chart.

  At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn’t have the src and alt attributes.
The <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height.
The canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
The <canvas> element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…).
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space.
