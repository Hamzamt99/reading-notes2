# Transitions and animation:-
One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
With CSS3 transitions We have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs.
The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
Scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
Skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.
