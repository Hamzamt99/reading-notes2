## Html:
+ All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

+ The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

+ The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.*

## JS:
+ Objects
+ Object references and copying
+ Garbage collection
+ Object methods, "this"
+ Constructor, operator "new"
+ Optional chaining '?.'
+ Symbol type
+ Object to primitive conversion

## Css:
Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language.
CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:

p {
  color: red;
}
