# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout:
## 1-HTML Links - Hyperlinks

![Html links](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ_W8w4dGULU73y_Xr_ovAKP0zPLMBBSdKbcQ&usqp=CAU)

HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
## HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

### Example
This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com:

<a href="https://www.google.com/">Visit google.com!</a>
  
## 2-JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Example
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.

Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)  
  
## 3- CSS layout
At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. 
  Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another.
  We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
