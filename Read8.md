*This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules, such as different display values, as well as introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.*

### CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, and the main viewport/window. The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are:
+ Normal flow
+ The display property
+ Flexbox
+ Grid
+ Floats
+ Positioning
+ Table layout

Multiple-column layout
Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages.
No technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each layout method is designed for you'll be in a good position to understand which method is most appropriate for each task.
