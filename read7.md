# Constructor functions:
  
 Constructor functions are templates for creating objects. We can use it to create different objects using the same constructor, which has the same instance methods and properties with different values for the nonmethod properties.
  We can use the instanceof operator to check if an object is created from a constructor

  # Define an HTML Table : 

 The <table tag defines an HTML table.
  
 Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.

By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.
